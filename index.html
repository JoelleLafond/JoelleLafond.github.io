I am now closing a big chapter of my life, as my PhD thesis will be handed by the end of 2023. As of January 2024, I will be a postdoc at the University of British Columbia (UBC), in the lab 
of <a href="https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/mank-lab/">Dr. Judith Mank</a>. I will be working on the evolution of sex chromosomes in the awesome guppies! Stay tuned!
